RBAC - Role Based Access Control

    - Defines roles and permissions
    - Assign permission to roles
    - Validate if a user is authorized to perform an action (by role probably)
    - Expose a simple API for:
        - Adding new Roles/Permissions
        - checking permissions (used by API Gateway or other services)
